Technical - the Star array - and 1 byte Move commands in chibi akumas

    The 'star array' is the normal bullet routine that handles the players
bullets, the enemy bullets - and also the particles on the Turbo-R version.

    Each bullet has 1 byte 3 variables, a Y position, an X position and a Move

    The data is byte aligned for a 256 byte array, so if the star array started
at &0100, then bullet 3's Y co-ordinate would be &0102, it's X co-ordinate would
be  &0202 and the move would be at  &0302.

    A Y position of 0 means that star is not in use, so this is used to find
 empty slots for new stars, and decide which stars need drawing. The star array
 remembers how big the in use array is, and wont try to draw more than needed,
 to save a little time

    Enemy bullets may hit the player, so when drawing the enemy bullets, the
players location 'hit box' is pre-calculated and inserted into the conditions
by 'self modifying code' to reduce the amount of time during the star loop - for
the player loop this hit code is also disabled by self modifying code... 

    player bullets hitting enemies is handled during the 'object drawing loop'
which draws enemies and background objects.

    'Moves' in Chibiakumas are a 1 byte command where each bit has a meaning 

0-------  normal move - Explained below
1-------  Special move - handled by various program code... these do everything
          from coins flying towards the player, super-slow moving backgrounds -
          and custom program code for boss animation

Normal moves:
-1------  Fast Move  - speed up object movement.
-0------  Normal Move 
--YYYXXX  Move direction in Y and X axis 


    This results in a grid of possible moves for any bullet or object which
appears as below - note move 24 or 64 would be static, and would never move -
and in the case of bullets - never leave the screen!

    For example, 1C will move up the screen slowly, 7F will move towards the
bottom right very fast. 18 will go fast to the right and up slowly!
