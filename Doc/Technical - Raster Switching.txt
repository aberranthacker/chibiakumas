    The Amstrad CPC screen hardware allows for Interrupts at 6 points down the
screen, and if we change the colors at those points, we can simulate more colors
on-screen.

    The first of these interrupts occurs in the 'Border area'... so is not shown
in normal circumstances.. the second is also mostly offscreen, so we can
realisticly use 4 interrupt based color changes.

    In Chibiakumas... Color 0 is a constant color, and the 3rd color is always
White (this means 'White' enemies can cross the color boundaries without looking
wierd!)... Color 2 is always brighter than Color 1, but Colors 1&2 can be anything!

the color changes are defined by a 'color change block of 5 labels for each of
the usable raster interrupts, eg:

RasterColors_ColorArray1: ;Label to the block (5 in total)
    defb 1                ;Number of Colors in the block
    defb 1                ;Delay
    defb 64+20,64+24,64+29,64+11 ;4 hardware colors
RasterColors_ColorArray2: ;Label to the block
    defb 2                ;Number of Colors in the block
    defb 1                ;Delay
    defb 64+20,64+12,64+13,64+11 ;4 hardware colors
    defb 0                ;Delay
    defb 64+20,64+24,64+29,64+11 ;4 hardware colors
....

    The labels are used to 'self-modify' the interrupt handler.
    Each block can contain more than 1 color... each color change occurs after a
software 'delay'... note this wastes CPU power, so is not really viable 'ingame'
but does allow for precise (and far more) color-changes during the title and
levels... there is a delay per color block, and the delay happens before the
color change.

    a call to "Akuyou_RasterColors_SetPointers" will define all the labels that
point to the colors... it's also possible to define a 'screen refresh interrupt
handler'... this will at 50hz... and can be used to 'flip palettes' each screen
draw... this is done to simulate colors that do not exist on the CPC by
alternating between two similar colors... which will appear as a 'between' color
due to the image persistance of CRT phosphors.

    The CPC PLUS has a new alternate raster color switcher... it allows precise
'line no based' hardware refreshes... so there is no need for delays...
unfortunately, however if Interrupts were disabled for too long, and two
interrupts were missed... the colors will not update until the whole next screen
redraw... this means it's not advisable to have 2 color changes less than about
10 lines apart... also Chibi akumas has a limit of 8 color changes per screen...
this is due to memory shortage in the Core... not a limitation of the CPC PLUS

    You cannot specify a color change of 0... this has a special meaning... you
must specify a color change at 200... this tells the core to update the music...
all 8 colorchanges must be defined  - with the last at 200...
'ideal' valuese are 25,50,75,100,125,150,175,200

    Note that PLUS Icons are relocated midscreen to allow more onscreen sprites
than possible for the CPC... this occurs around line 32.
