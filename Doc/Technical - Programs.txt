    As mentioned before, the 6th byte of the object array is the 'program', This
defines what actions the object performs, such as whether it shoots, if it has
special actions, and allows for special sprite animation, the possible programs
are shown below:

%00000000 - Object with no program (also effectively Spritebank 0)
%00000001 - Bitshift Sprite
            the CPC has 80 byte positions across the screen, but Chibi Akumas
            uses X co-ords from 0-160 - this program allows the second sprite
            frame to be used for every other X co-ord, allowing for a half shift
            of the object... this is used by background objects on the CPC such
            as the gravestones on level 1, it has no function on the spectrum
            (where color clashing makes this useless) or MSX (where 1 byte is 2
            pixels meaning the resolution is really 160 across)
%0000xxxx - Powerups
            Powerups are objects with special properties, they generally are not
            affected by smartbombs, and have special effects when they hit the
            player... coins are also powerups, and some special objects such as
            "enemy hit targets" are also powerups
%0001xxxx - Smartbombable powerup
            These are special objects which are hit by a smartbomb - this is
            really only used for allowing enemies to have strange animation
            using power up options 5-7 (set object spritebank)
%101fffff - Hyper Fire
            Fire bullets extremely fastwith pattern fffff - can only really be
            used with single bullets not bursts
%001fffff - Fast Fire
            Fire bullets fastwith pattern fffff
%110fffff - Mid Fire 2
            Fire bullets quite fastwith pattern fffff  (Faster than Midfire)
%010fffff - Mid Fire
            Fire bullets somewhat fastwith pattern fffff
%011fffff - Slow Fire
            Fire bullets slowly with pattern fffff
%100fffff - Snail Fire
            Fire bullets very slowly with pattern fffff
%11111100 - Custom program 1
            Custom programs are overridable by level code, these are used for
            special movements, sprite animation and bullet fire
            There are currently 3 available, by default they do nothing until
            the level code defines where they should jump
%11111101 - Custom program 2
%11111110 - Custom program 3
%11111111 - Move chibiko towards object (Used for joke in ep2 where chibiko runs off!)

Powerups:      (These can currently be 0-8... add +16 for smartbombable versions
%xxxxx001 (0)  Default object (also effectively Spritebank 0)
%xxxxx001 (1)  Bitshift sprite (background oject) - mentioned above
%xxxxx010 (2)  Special - this has no function, it is used in CustomPrograms as a
               detectable marker to see if, for example, the enemy hitzone has
               been shot
%xxxxx100 (3)  Coin or player powerup
%xxxxx100 (4)  Move both players towards object (used for end of level)
%xxxxx101 (5)  Set object spritebank to 1
%xxxxx110 (6)  Set object spritebank to 2
%xxxxx110 (7)  Set object spritebank to 3
%xxxxx111 (8)  Custom program 1 - this is the same as Custom program 1 above,
               however this is an object that cannot be killed by a smart bomb

Bullet patterns:
These can be from 1-31
%xxx00000 (0)  No effect
%xxx00001 (1)  Fire 1/4 burst TopLeft
%xxx00010 (2)  Fire 1/4 burst BottomLeft
%xxx00011 (3)  Fire 1/4 burst TopRight
%xxx00100 (4)  Fire 1/4 burst BottomRight
