On the amstrad CPC+ Chibi Akumas uses hardware sprites to enhance the game.

The basic CPC screen can only do 4 colors - and ChibiAkumas enhances those colors by switching the palette while the raster dtaws, however this causes the player sprite to change color when it moves across the boundary of a color switch.

To combat this Plus sprites are used to draw the player characters. A CPC plus sprite can be 15 colors with 1 transpartent color, and is 16x16 pixels - The CPC plus can define 16 sprites.

Each player is 32x32 pixels, and is drawn with 4 PlusSprites, as the game is 2 player, 8 sprites are used for the players.

The 'Drones' are also drawn with Plus sprites, bringing the total to 10 - this is why there can only be a maximum of 2 drones even in 2 player mode.

The Heart Life icons , and Scroll Smartbombs are also plus sprites - there is a maximum of 3 each, meaning 6 sprites just for player 1 - this totals 16... however there is a trick! The sprites are relocated half way down the screen, so player 1's hearts and scrolls are in the opposite position to player 2's - this allows 6 hardware sprites to appear as if they are 12!

The 2 frames of flying animation are copied to the sprite definitions in 'ASIC' memory - This 'Asic' memory is enabled via a special OUT... CPC plus sprite memory is odd it only uses the low nibble each byte - however to save memory the 'Flying animation' sprites are held in ram using both nibbles, and bitshifting is done before writing to this Asic memory.

The new EP2 also support the CPC Plus Palette... The CPC plus allows setting of colors from a palette of 4096, and allows line level interrupts - rather than the 300hz ones on the CPC... so rather the MAX 4 raster color switches on the CPC, I use 8 on the CPC+ giving up to 32 colors for the background - and 47 counting the CPC plus sprites!
