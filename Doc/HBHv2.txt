
Q: Thank you for agreeing to our interview, please take a moment to  tell us a little about you?

*** My name is Keith, I was born in England, and I moved to Japan for work around 2011, I grew up on the Amstrad CPC, but these days I collect most systems I can get my hands on.

Q: What was the first game you created?

*** The new game is an enhanced version of my original "ChibiAkumas" game, but I wrote a large number of little basic games in the 80's, I don't think they really had names, most of them were based on 'type ins' I did, that were heavilly re-written.

Q: What do you for a living now?
***  I work for a small company in Japan, my job title is IT Manager, but I'm basically the IT department, so I'm a "Jack of all trades" and do everything from software development and training to graphic design.

Q: Whats next?

***  I'm hoping to release the game in Japanese, Russian and Spanish... and I'm planning a port for the Enterprise 128 (a rare system similar to the CPC)... I'm hoping to do a couple of 'minigames' based on the current shooter-game engine... I have some other big games planned after that, but time constraints will mean I won't start work on anything major until next year.

I'm also working on a series of retro programming tutorials, which are proving popular, but are taking time that I could spend developing!

Q: Any thoughts for doing games on other systems? CPC464, Dreamcast or SNES.

*** Difficult to say at this time, I'd like to focus on the Z80 systems for now, so a Gameboy or Master System game would be more likely, but anything is possible... I wouldn't be too interested in a 'Modern' 3D system like the Dremcast, but a 16 bit system like the Megadrive or NeoGeo would be something I'd consider if I had time, but I'm pretty busy these days, so focusing only on the Z80 means I can be more efficient.

Q: Are you surprised with the resurgence in retro gaming?
*** At the moment I think the current popularity is because people like myselves, who are reaching middle age and have money to spare are pursuing it.
The popularity of these recreated and 'Mini' consoles does suprpris me... in the second hand store near me, the SuperFamicomMini sells for 6000 yen, but there is a stack of real famicoms for sale for 600 yen

Q: Do you have any games that are just sitting on your drives  unfinished that you may release one day?
*** Nothing recent, I was terrible for that when I was a kid, but these days I'm pretty focused, so if I get something off the ground, I get it finished... I started writing an Iphone 'rythem game' some years ago that I abandoned, but by now, it would just be easier to start again than continue it, the iphone has changed so much, I doubt I could even compile it any more.

Q: Can you tell us what prompted you to get involved in Retro Game  Development?
*** I've spent much of the last 10 years learning Japanese, I was looking for a new hobby, and Z80 Assembly was something I never really picked up in my youth, and as I started learning it, I found it a pleasent change from developing more modern systems, so I've been putting most of my spare time into learning more systems, and trying to get better at it.

Q: What games at the time (and now) would you say are your biggest  inspirations?
*** Design wise ChibiAkumas is inspired by arcade games like DeathSmiles and Cotton, the biggest inspiration for getting back into the Amstrad CPC was the 'Batman Forever  Demo'... I never imagined something like that could be done on the old Amstrad CPC, and it stands as a reminder that you can't assume that just because something hasn't been done that it's not possible...
During original development of my game, I kept it very quiet what I was working on, I'm pretty sure if I'd posted "I'm trying to make my first CPC game, it's going to be a crazy shooter with hundreds of onscreen bullets like I have on my xbox 360" people would have called me an idiot... and told me it couldn't be done, or wasn't possible for a beginner... but I made it!


Q: What is the biggest challenge you face with the limitations of the  hardware, particularly as you continue to expand features  title-to-title? (Memory? Graphical capability? Speed?)
*** With 8 bit development you're always trading Speed for Memory, you can be fast but waste bytes, or small but waste speed... if you're looking to create a game which comes across as 'impressive', then you really have to design the game 'around' the limitations, so you don't have to do the things the system is slow at.
Each system has challenges, with the Spectrum, it's the 'color attribute screen', with the MSX it's working with the relatively slow VDP (graphics chip), and with the CPC it's getting data to its 16k screen fast enough! 

Q: Do you have timelines built in to the management of these games?
*** Yes, I have an expected completion date, and I allocate the time accordingly, with this game, I was aiming to complete 1 level a month, with developing starting in December, and ending in March, Debugging and testing took longer than I expected, but I try to set myself 'Time limits'... you can't spend all your time perfecting the first level, and never finishing the rest of the game.

I have my own weekly targets too.. at the moment I aim to work at least 14 hours on game development, which is effectively, "spend at least half of every evening developing, and do a couple of hours each day at the weekend."

Motivation is a big factor, and if you want to see your game finished, you have to work on it even when you don't feel like it, so working to a routine, and setting targets is a way of accomplishing that.


Q: Are you doing all the development individually?
*** At the moment I do everything myself, during my working life a lot of the projects I deal with get delayed or even cancelled because of disagreements between people, or waiting for datafrom other users... I do every aspect of my games, from design, through programming to tesing, drawing graphics and composing Music...
That said, I'm planning translated versions of the game for Japanese, Russian and Spanish, and I've got 3 native speakers helping me out there!.. I can write Japanese, but not without a proof reader!

Q: Will there be a physical release of the game?

The game is available for preorder on MSX, CPC and ZX Spectrum from Polyplay.
