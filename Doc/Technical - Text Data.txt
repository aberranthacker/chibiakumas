    As previously mentioned, in Chibi Akumas Text co-ordinates are based on the
CPC's firmare co-ordinate of  0-39 columns, and 0-24 rows.
On MSX/ZX the physical screen is smaller,so the visible text co-ordinates are
now from 4-35 across  0-23 down - this means the 'center' of the screen is the
same - minimizing changes.

General Text:

    Text in ChibiAkumas is not compressed, and varies in format slightly
depending on language, so lets take a look at a typical 'single line of data
	db "Continue","?"+&80
or
	db "CONTINUE","?",255
    You'll notice in the top example the last character has 128 added to it to
note an end of line - this is the 'english' version, and the bottom one has a
byte with 255 for end of line - this is the 'non english' version.
    This is because Russian and Japanese need more characters than 32-127 would
allow, so the range has been 'extended' by changing the 'end of line character'.
Also to reduce characters, non engligh charset lanugages do not have lower case
letters.

Lets take a look at a multiline example
	db 15,"You're Dead!"," "+&80
	db 17,"(Again!)"," "+&80
	db 0
you'll notice that each line is prepended with a number - this is the starting X
co-ordinate (the Y position will be one lower than the last line)...
the last line ends with a 0 - which means the text has ended.

    Instead of an X pos, there are some special commands you can use in certian
cases!
	252 - set normal font
	254 - set Mini font (half width)
	253 - Zero pos... yes it's a bugfix! as I'd used Zero as 'end of text'..
	      I needed something when I really needed to print text at Xpos 0!

Now lets take a look at the Japanese equivalent:
	db 15,125,158,125,159,109,112,129,"!",255
	db 17,139,159,114,113,119,"!",255
	db 0
    Whoa! numbers! these are the 'character positions' in the ChibiAkumas Font,
I use a small windows .Net app to convert the japanese symbols to the right
binary numbers for the program

Interactive Insults:
    'spoken text' does not have an X co-ordinate, as it's positioned according
to the character who's speaking, it also has some extra features, so lets take
a look!
	db 1,"That's the stupidest s--t",13,"I've ever heard","!"+&80,8
	db 1,"Seriously, Why can't I be",13
	db "in a GOOD GAME?",13,"F--k this s--t!",13,"I'm outta here","!"+&80
	db 12

    This is a line of Chibiko's speech from Ep2, in which she leaves the game
in a huff!... you'll see it uses special characters from 1-13, so lets take a
look what they do
	 1 = Chibiko speaks!
	 2 = Boccan speaks!
	 3 = hero (yumi/yume) speaks!
	 4 = Achievement... used for achievement unlocked messages
	 5 = Boss
	 8 = new caption  (pause) +stop hero speech anim
	 9 = new caption (pause) - used when hero is walking away
	10 =end of prebattle speech - battle begins!
	11 =hero leaves screen while speech still goes on
	12 =Level specific Special command (eg chibiko walks out)
	13 =newline (cursor returns to 1 line below last line, same X position)
	14 =Level specific Special command command (eg chibiko return point)

    More advanced 8 bit games may use some kind of compression, but text in
ChibiAkumas is relatively limited, so it wasn't needed.
