	SPOILERS ALERT!

Today I'll be covering the 'story' of Chibi Akumas EP1 - there are spoilers in this document, so please don't read this if you want the story to be a surprise!

I started developing Chibi akumas with only a vauge idea of a 'bad' Vampire fighting monsters, but I needed to work out a proper story.

I had decided I wanted the game to have a 'stereotypical' gothic theme, so I decided the levels should be fairly 'typical' - I knocked up plans of the level themes in about 20 mins on a scrap of paper! - the styles 'Mountain-Forest-River-Cave' was supposed to be a linear journey from Chibiko's home to stop the monsters... there was going to be an 'underworld' level originally but I scaled back a bit!

I had enough to start developling the game, and drawing the level graphics, and I started thinking out the backstory of the character as I worked on the game.

I wanted the main character to be an 'antihero' vampire - and I wanted her to be the ONLY vampire in the fictional world of the game... for this to be the case, I needed some explaination of how she had become a vampire - as no one else could have made her one.

I started thinking about this, and I came up with the idea that maybe she had been turned into a vampire by the divine as some kind of punishment for her misdeeds - I liked the idea that she was the 'worst person on the planet' so she became the 'only vampire on the planet'... the idea of blasphemy against God was in the original Dracula story - so this worked well for me.

I needed an idea of something she could do that was bad enough to cause such punishment - and it was quite tough to work out a viable 'sin'
* It had to be bad enough that the idea she had recieved divine punishment was plausable.
* The character was supposed to be a kid - so it would be implausable to having her start a world war or anything.
* I didn't want to have her do anything that would get me in trouble! I thought of having her block up the cooling of a nuclear power plant - but as I live in Japan, with the recent problems I thought that may be a bad idea!
* It had to be something that no-one could actually do - having her blow up a building or something wouldn't be a good idea.

The idea I settled on was based on Die Hard 2 - in which there's a scene where a plane crash is caused by tricking the plain into crashing into the ground. I had the daft idea that Chibiko could have constructed a fake runway out of giant 'garden lights'... and caused a plane to crash into her school - of course this would never actually work, but it had some vaguae plausibility to make the plot work.

Whats more, her resason for doing it was as pathetic and selfish as I could imagine - she did it because she was too lazy to study for a test!

I would have liked to have shown her being kicked out of hell, but it would have taken a lot of time and graphics in the introduction, so instead I decided that she had been declared too bad to even be let in!

With a few other past 'bad deeds' I pretty much had the introduction worked out - and I decided it should be in the style of a 'fairy tale' - there were three reasons for this
1. I wanted to play down the bad deeds to make the character still vaguely likable 
2. It would make everything more plausible and fit in with the comic style game
3. I had just read Kizumonogatari, which had an introduction chapter in this style - and I felt it really worked well for the book.

As I developed the game I had to work out what I was going to have for the last boss. I had decided I wanted to try to have a huge number of bullets - which really forced me to a small character - I also wanted the enemy to teleport around the screen to keep the attack source changing.
I thought the last boss should be some kind of wizard (eventually called the 'necromancer')... and came up with the idea this should be someone who wanted revenge on Chibiko!

This idea developed quite quickly - originally the 'monster invasion' which was annoying Chibiko was going to be a 'seasonal annoyance' like an annual migration that Chibiko had to put up with... however when I decided Chibiko was going to have started off as a human it seemed that I needed the game to start with the normal world we are used to, and end up somewhere strange and surreal.

I came up with an alternated idea - The monsters had never come before - Chibiko went to try and find out what was causing them, and found out it was her past bad deeds that had caused the problem!... if you look at the text of the 'Necromancer' - He's thinks Chibiko's has come to kill him for no reason - he hasn't done anything to her, so he's actually the 'last victim' rather than the 'last boss'

One thing I didn't want was for Chibiko to learn her lesson! there's too many stories out there of 'bad-guy turned good'... and I wanted this to be something different! Chibiko will continue doing bad things... and she'll keep suffering for them! Part of the backstory of the character is that her vampirism has made her immortal, but like with 'Peter pan syndrome' she can't (mentally) mature, so she'll keep making stupid mistakes, and blaming others for them! - Chibiko (like the other Chibi Akumas I introduced later) is supposed to be the 'bad example'... the game is supposed to  be saying 'Do you want to end up failing like this pathetic charater... no? well don't behave like they did!' - each character has a blatant personality flaw that drives them and causes their endless failure.

The plot progressed further with Episode 2... but we'll cover that some other day!
