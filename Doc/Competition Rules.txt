Below are the official rules of the "T-shirt competition"

1.Entry
veryone who enters the competition will have 1 chance to win a T-shirt... entrants names will be selected at random, all patreons will have an equal chance to win, anyone who has entered before the draw date can win, even if their lifetime payments are still zero (new subs)...

To enter just fill in the patreon only poll, or private message me if you prefer

2.Announcement
If you win I will request the address you want the prize sending to, and the size you require - please note I will have to get sizes I need printing, so delivery will be at least a few weeks later.

Winners will be notified by private message - their names will not be made public... however, if I have not recieved at least 1 dollar from you, you will not be notified until first payment is taken, if I have still not recieved a single dollar recieved 40 days later (eg if your account has no valid card), the prize will be issued to someone else... this is to stop people signing up and immediately cancelling if they do not win

3. Get out Clause!
I will be paying shipping... In the event you live on an oil rig or somewhere with impossibly high shipping I retain the right not to send you the T-shirt, and instead I will pay you 25 dollars to a paypal account of your choice as compensation... note this is at my descression - you cannot request the cash prize if you don't want the t-shirt.

Any questions, just ask!


Patrons, choose YES here, and you'll have a chance to win one of 3 Tshirts! I can the email address of voters, so I'll contact you after the draw for address and size details.
