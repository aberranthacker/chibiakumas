*** Level 1 ***

After a hard night massacring
villagers and harvesting their
Blood,Chibiko is having a well
earned days sleep. Suddenly She
is awoken by A swarm of noizy,
ill concieved and badly drawn
Monsters, that are invading her
Castle and disturbing the peace!
Chibiko's not the kind of
Vampire to take that! Time to
'Rise from your grave' and give
hell to whoever sent them!


*** Level 2 ***

The monsters climbing the
mountain seem to be coming
from the forest.Its time to
push forward, and stop the
invasion!

to have become mutants,zombies
& generally super-annoying
But no matter what monsters
lurks in the forest it will
be no match for Chibiko's
Black Magic!!!

reveal whoever sent them
and stop this annoyance once
and for all!

cave is are only lit by 
phosphor rock and Glowing
creatures!
Victory is in your grasp!
Go in there, and sort this
Shit out!


*** Bad Score Insults ***

I'd say the purpose
of your existance is
to define utter failure
so the rest of the
population can feel
superior!



Never mind!
Maybe you will manage
to serve some purpose
one day!?!
You DO own an organ
donor card don't you?


If YOU are the result
of 2 million years of
human evolution I'd say
the species is
seriously fucked!


You're really something
after all, It's rare to
see someone CLINICALLY
BRAINDEAD still able to
play computer games!


*** Good Score Insults ***

Well Done!
I'm sure there's worse
players out there,
I mean, the world
population is 7 billion
There MUST be, right?



Superb Performace!
Imagine how good you'll
be when you actually
learn how to play!


Amazing!!!
You survived SUCH a
long time by aimlessly
hitting buttons at
random!


Good Job!
Now try plugging the
controller in first
before starting the
game!

*** Won Game Insults ***

Well, you won!
But I'm still giving
you an F!
