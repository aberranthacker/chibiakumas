What do the Amstrad CPC, 
The ZX Spectrum,
The MSX
And the TI-83 calculator have in common?
Well, they all use the Z80 CPU!

And that means we can write our own programs
and make them do what we want!

On my channel, I'll show you that these old systems are still worth looking it,
and that even an absolute beginner using only free software can write their own
games as good as the professionals did in the 80's... 

As you'll learn everything you need to know about programming these systems,
you'll learn about the fundamentals of computers and processors - and have some
fun along the way!

So please subscribe to my Channel, and Join me in my 8-bit adventures!


My Patreons who back me are supporting my on-going multiplatform game development
and are allowing me to develop new and exciting games for old 8 bit systems!

My backers will get all the secrets about the game design, in depth detail of the how the games work 
and weekly updates detailing the status of the games, all the challenges I'm facing along the way, 
and the solutions I come up with!

What's more, My patreon backers will gain access to the finished games before everyone else,
their feedback will be given special priority during the development process, and patreons will have 
the chance to win exclusive merchandise and prizes!
